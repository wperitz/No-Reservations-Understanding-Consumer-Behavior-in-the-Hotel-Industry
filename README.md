#### Authored by: Justin Chuderewicz, Mitchell Flattum, Andrew Hunter, William Peritz

## Regression Question

Our analysis focused on answering a crucial question: **Which factors influence the number of nights a person will stay in hotels?** Understanding these factors is essential for the hotel industry as it enables businesses to optimize pricing, marketing strategies, and promotions based on consumer behavior and macroeconomic conditions.

### Stakeholders

Relevant stakeholders include:
- **Hotel Management and Owners**: Directly impacted by booking habits and economic performance.
- **Hotel Marketing Teams**: Need insights for effective campaign targeting.
- **Hotel Financial Analysts**: Require an understanding of customer behavior for financial planning and forecasting.
- **Tourism Boards**: Interested in tourism trends and hotel occupancy for regional planning and development.

### Key Findings

Through our analysis, we identified several key factors influencing the length of hotel stays:
- **Factors Increasing Nights Stayed**:
  - Higher average price per night
  - More adults and children in the booking party
  - Longer time between booking and reservation date

- **Factors Decreasing Nights Stayed**:
  - **Consumer Price Index (CPI)**: A higher CPI for the hotel industry leads to shorter stays as consumers face increased costs.
  - **Average Fuel Prices**: Higher fuel prices result in shorter stays due to increased travel expenses.

### Recommendations

1. **Adaptive Pricing Strategies**:
   - Implement dynamic pricing based on factors affecting stay length. For example, lower prices during periods when shorter stays are common to encourage longer reservations.

2. **Targeted Marketing Strategies**:
   - Adjust marketing efforts to appeal to demographics more likely to book longer stays. Allocate marketing budgets to align with periods of longer stays.

3. **Tailored Packages**:
   - Offer incentives such as a free night with the purchase of several nights to encourage longer bookings.

4. **Economic Impact Mitigation**:
   - Develop strategies to counteract economic downturns that lead to shorter stays, such as flexible pricing or special promotions during challenging times.

## Classification Question

In addition to understanding stay lengths, our analysis addressed another crucial question: **Which factors influence hotel reservation cancellations?** Identifying predictors of cancellations can enhance economic and marketing strategies, improve customer segmentation, and boost operational efficiency.

### Stakeholders

The same stakeholders for the regression analysis are also affected by cancellation factors:
- **Hotel Management and Owners**
- **Hotel Marketing Teams**
- **Hotel Financial Analysts**
- **Tourism Boards**

### Key Findings

Our models, including Ridge and Lasso regression, Regression Trees, and Random Forests, revealed several key predictors of cancellations:
- **Increase in Time Between Booking and Reservation**: Longer lead times increase the likelihood of cancellation.
- **Deposit Type**: Nonrefundable deposits were found to lead to more cancellations, possibly due to changing circumstances or buyerâ€™s remorse.

### Recommendations

1. **Responsive Pricing Strategies**:
   - Adjust pricing based on cancellation predictors, potentially offering more flexible terms to reduce cancellations.

2. **Targeted Marketing Strategies**:
   - Develop campaigns focused on demographics with lower cancellation rates.

3. **Tailored Packages**:
   - Create packages to attract customers with a lower likelihood of cancellation.

4. **Cancellation Policy Adjustments**:
   - Modify policies during high-risk periods to minimize revenue loss.

5. **Economic Downturn Mitigation**:
   - Plan for economic downturns that increase cancellation rates with flexible pricing and promotional strategies.

### Conclusion

This analysis provides valuable insights for stakeholders in the hospitality industry, offering ways to enhance economic performance, marketing strategies, and operational efficiency. By understanding both factors influencing stay lengths and reservation cancellations, hotels can better meet market demands and adapt to economic changes, leading to improved financial health and customer satisfaction.
